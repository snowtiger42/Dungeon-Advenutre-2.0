Dungeon Adventure:
By: Nik van Baak, Kevin Perkins, Fikadu Balcha

				
				Team Responsibilites:

Name: Nik van Baak

Nik is responsible for making the dungeon class as well as the dungeon_adventure game methods.

Total Time: 10+ hrs

Nik started off with a bang by first making and then providing a blueprint for what each class should look like and what it would need. This helped
me and Fikadu make our room and adventurer classes much faster (as well as giving our team a unfied syntax for specific methods). By getting those 
classes (mostly) out of the way, we were able to focus on other parts of the project; such as me and Nik working on the dungeon adventure classes' GUI.
Nik was able to get the dungeon class he made, to print onto the tkinter canvas and to use the keyboard to move the adventurer in four directions and to 
use potions. He also effectily integrated the conditions to end the game by using the code me and Fikadu provided.

The chief difficulty Nik dealt with was getting the message bar to print evenly (ran out of time).  


Name: Kevin Perkins

Kevin is unoffically responsible for scheduling the meetings. Officially, he is responsible for making the adventurer class and the start menu 
(GUI) for the dungeon_adventure class. 

Total Time: 10+ hrs

The inital work for the adventure class was relativly simpe and took me about 2 hrs. Most of it was simple, however the parts that worried me
for a while was the use_vision_potion class. In the begining, I wasn't sure how vision would interact with dungeon adventure. It took a 
collaberation between Nik and I to parse it out. Then we added a decay_vision method so that the effects of a vision potion decrease after a
player moves. 

The Dungeon adventure part was more challenging since none of use were really experienced with tkinter. For our background, Nik provided and 
image(png) that I was able to figure out how to pin as our canvas's background. I then created several buttons that would allow the play to start, input 
the name and difficulty, ask for instructions or quit. There's also a help option on the top that describes how to use the keyboard to move the
adventurer and how to use potions and cheat codes (yes there are cheat codes). 

 


Name: Fikadu Balcha

Fikadu is responsible for the room class as well as making the groups UML.
Class is where the game adventure happens. Creating room class isn't complex but in areas where I have blcocked, discussed with Nik and Kevin so solve problems I faced.  

Time taken: 8 hours
