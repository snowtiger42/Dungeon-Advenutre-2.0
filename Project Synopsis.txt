Team P!(N)K:
Pranav Venkatesh Ramkrishnan, (Na)talia Nauman, Kevin Perkins

What did we do on this project?

Pranav:


(Na)talia:


Kevin:
I was the one who set all the meetings on zoom, set up the GitHub, and organized/turned in all of our work for each iteration. I also provided the Dungeon.
I made all of the Abstract classes (Dungeon Character, Hero and Monster (Talia helped a bit with Monster)) as well as the hero child classes. I then 
set to work on making a GUI that would enable the player to combat monsters that they'd encounter within the maze. 
I'm also organizing the SRS/Synopsis and probably the presentation.


Problems we faced?

Pranav:


(Na)talia:


Kevin:
I had a difficult time getting the Abstract classes to work initally, which slowed me down. This ended up eating up the amount of time I got to spend on
the GUI which kept me from adding features that I'd have liked to commit (no resizer again)


Total Hours?

Pranav:


(Na)talia:


Kevin:
57 Hours and counting.



Short Comings?

Pranav:


(Na)talia:


Kevin:
Wasn't able to get the text produced by combat to be read on the textboxs in time.


Items worthy of extra credit?

Pranav:


(Na)talia:


Kevin:
Lot of GUI work (especially from the combat)
