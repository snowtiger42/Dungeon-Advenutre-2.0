Team P!(N)K:
Pranav Venkatesh Ramkrishnan, (Na)Talia Nauman, Kevin Perkins

What did we do on this project?

Pranav:
I was the one who set up toggle and pivotal tracker and invited the group to join. 
I worked on creating a Sqlite database to store quiz questions, and the GUI that would display the selected question when a player reached a piller.
I implemented music into the game.
I helped in integrating the quiz class with the room class and the battleground class, allowing the game to switch from dunceon to quiz to battleground seamlessly.
I also worked on a pause menu class and a sound menu class, but had trouble integrating them to the final product.
I also had trouble seperating the main menu from the dungeon adventure class.

(Na)Talia:
I stored data for the monsters in a SQLite database, retrieved it at the start of the program, and used it to generate and place monsters in the 
dungeon. I contributed to the combat between the hero and the monster and created the quiz for the sphinx to deliver at each pillar. 
I completed the UML and contributed to the SRS and the Project Synopsis. I encouraged and followed Agile methodologies throughout the project. 


Kevin:
I was the one who set all the meetings on zoom, set up the GitHub, and organized/turned in all of our work for each iteration. I also provided the Dungeon.
I made all of the Abstract classes (Dungeon Character, Hero and Monster (Talia helped a bit with Monster)) as well as the hero child classes. I then 
set to work on making a GUI that would enable the player to combat monsters that they'd encounter within the maze. 
I'm also organizing the SRS/Synopsis and probably the presentation.


Problems we faced?

Pranav:
I worked on a pause menu class and a sound menu class, but had trouble integrating them to the final product.
I also had trouble seperating the main menu from the dungeon adventure class.
Both ideas had to be put aside for the final submission.
Since the classes were interlinked with the GUI elements, and not in the model view controller pattern, it was impossible to pickle in order to save.
we had to scrap save/load feature for the final product, but could have probably fixed it given more time.


(Na)Talia:
I had some difficulty understanding how to place monsters in another team's dungeon. I also had some unusual technical problems for a few weeks during the project. 
I learned from my ISP that my IP address had been blacklisted and they gave me a new IP address. However, service continued lagging occasionally, so I think I will try to find a more reliable ISP. 


Kevin:
I had a difficult time getting the Abstract classes to work initally, which slowed me down. This ended up eating up the amount of time I got to spend on
the GUI which kept me from adding features that I'd have liked to commit (no resizer again)


Total Hours?

Pranav:
61 hours.


(Na)Talia:
80 hours


Kevin:
61 Hours



Short Comings?

Pranav:
Was not able to connect the pause menu and sound menu and integrate them. Was not able to create a save/load feature. 
Was not able to seperate the main menu functions from the dungeon adventure class and put them in their own class.


(Na)Talia:
It took more time than I thought to store data for the monsters in a SQLite database,. I had started with SQL alchemy, but later used the zip files 
from class to successfully use SQLite to create a database. 


Kevin:
Wasn't able to get the text produced by combat to be read on the textboxes in time. Nor could we get the Phoenix to appear under the right conditions.


Items worthy of extra credit?

Pranav:
Added music that plays during the game.
Sqlite database of quiz questions. Whenever a player collects a pillar, they are asked a quiz question related to the specific principle of OO. IF they get it wrong, the have to fight a sphinx.
GUI for quiz class.


(Na)Talia:
Placing each Sphinx in a pillar room with a quiz added by a team member. 



Kevin:
Lot of GUI work (especially from the combat and quiz classes). Also music.
