# Dungeon-Advenutre-2.0
Team P!NK: Pranav, Natalia, Kevin

Pranav:
Not Really. Maybe a small learning curve on how to use Toggle and Pivitol Tracker, but otherwise no problem.


Natalia:



Kevin:
Not really since this first iteration was meant to organize the project with brainstorming ideas/goals, forming the UML, and making unittests.
